This is a creation of mine that extends the basic express backend and react frontend as proposed by @woodburydev. I created the user login and registration flows and designed the beginnings of a frontend for the web application. The end goal of this would be to launch it as a social media for creators that has the link forwarding capacity of Linktree.

## Running Vealo

#### First, you will need to add your MongoDB server link url in 'server.js'. 

Then, you can launch the React app by cd'ing to the src folder and running the command:
```shell
npm start
```

Next, start the backend by cd'ing to the backend folder and running the command:
```shell
npm run start
```
