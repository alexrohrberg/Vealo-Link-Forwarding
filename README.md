# Welcome to Vealo

This is a creation of mine that extends the basic express backend and react frontend as proposed by @woodburydev. I created the user login and registration flows and designed the beginnings of a frontend for the web application. The end goal of this would be to launch it as a social media for creators that has the link forwarding capacity of Linktree.

## Running Vealo

### First, you will need to add your MongoDB server link url in 'server.js'. 

### Then, you can launch the React app by cd'ing to the src folder and running the command 'npm start' which will run 'App.js' on port 3000 by default.

### Next, start the backend by cd'ing to the backend folder and running the command 'npm run start' which start Nodemon for the file server.js.

Happy Coding!
